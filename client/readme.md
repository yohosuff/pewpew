- try running physics simulation on both the client and the server
  - perform regular updates (15/second?) to sync the client simulation with the server, as the server is the authority
  - keep in mind that the sync may cause jitter (probably when the players are rapidly changing their inputs)
- fun idea: fly around and shoot missiles at each other
- turret auto targets, can cycle targets, missiles track target, firing has cooldown?
- add steering behavior so player automatically tries to hit other players
- do 'king of the hill' where the 'hill' is a cirular area that randomly relocates and players try to bash each other out of it
- the flag should try to run away from the players
- infect other players with control virus that randomizes their controls
- players try to 'kick' a ball into the other team's 'net'
- grappling other players and flinging them around would be fun
- add toasts for certain events (player name changes, flag captures, players leaving/joining)
- allow players to pick their own persistant color
- Continuous Collision Detection
  - not supported by matter.js; box2d.js allegedly supports it
